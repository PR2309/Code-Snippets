~> These are the customized boiler-plate code snippets for some technologies or language.
~> It is used in VS Code with specific keyword to get a custom boiler-plate code.

~> Snippets are predefined code templates that expand into full code when you type a prefix + Tab / Enter.
~> Can be committed to GitHub under .vscode folder in root folder

~> File Extensions:
    *.code-snippets are global or workspace reusable snippet files, while *.json snippet files are language-specific and apply only to the defined programming language.
        - *.code-snippets files are global user snippets
        - *.json files are local user snippets

~> Usage:
    They are used to:
        (i) Reduce repetitive typing
        (ii) Avoid syntax errors
        (iii) Speed up development
        (iv) Maintain consistent code style

~> Types/ Levels:
    VS Code supports three levels of snippets:
        (i) Global User Snippets (*.code-snippets files):
            - Works on all languages & projects
            - Used in all projects
            - Used in all languages (unless restricted)
            - Example: (Works in JS, React, Node, anywhere)
                {
                    "Print to console": {
                        "prefix": "cl",
                        "body": "console.log($1);",
                        "description": "Log output to console"
                    }
                }
        (ii) Workspace Snippets (.vscode/*.code-snippets files): One project only
            - Restrict global snippet to a language
            - Example:
                {
                    "React useState": {
                        "scope": "javascriptreact",
                        "prefix": "us",
                        "body": [
                            "const [$1, set$2] = useState($3);"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            (iii) Language-specific Snippets	(<language>.json files): One language only
                - Snippets that work only for one language
                - File name format: <language>.json
                - Example:
                    {
                        "Arrow Function": {
                            "prefix": "af",
                            "body": [
                                "const $1 = ($2) => {",
                                    "  $0",
                                "};"
                            ],
                            "description": "Create arrow function"
                        }
                    }

~> Storage Paths:
    They are stored in:
        - Windows:
            C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\
        - Linux:
            ~/.config/Code/User/snippets/
        - macOS:
            ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets/

~> Placeholders
    (i) Cursor positions:           $1, $2	
    (ii) Final cursor position:     $0
    (iii) Default value:            ${1:name}
    (iv) one,two:                   ${1,2}

~> Snippets vs Extensions
    (Snippets)	            (Extensions)
    Simple templates	    Full features
    Lightweight	            Heavier
    Custom	                Pre-built
    Fast	                Powerful

~> Order of preference:
    Local overrides global.
    Workspace snippets > Language snippets > Global snippets

~> Real-world Example (React Dev)
    Global snippet → rfc
    Project snippet → apiCall
    Language snippet → useEffect

~> Working:
    How VS Code Knows When to Trigger a Snippet
    A snippet appears when:
        1. File language matches scope
        2. Typed text matches prefix
        3. Tab or Enter is pressed
        4. Settings involved:
            "editor.tabCompletion": "on"

~> To backup vscode snippets:
    Step 1>
        Create a folder named "vscode\snippets" if not exsists already
    Step 2>
        To copy all .json snipppets of vscode
        run this command:

            copy "$env:APPDATA\Code\User\snippets\*" vscode\snippets\

~> To Set-Up in VS Code:
    Step 1> 
        Press: "CTRL + SHIFT + P"
    Step 2> 
        Enter: ">Snippets: Configure Snippets"
    Step 3>
        Press Enter
    Step 4>
        Enter Name of that custom snippet, same as the file for user understanding.
        <SnippetName>.json
        Example:  c.json, cpp.json, html.json, csharp.json, etc.
    Step 5>
        Copy and Paste the code.
        Or write own custom snippet taking referrence from comments and these code files.
    Step 6>
        Press "Enter" to save it
    Step 7> (To use it)
        Enter the value of "prefix" in the code.
        Then, press "Enter".
    Step 8>
        Navigate to change only custom values, using "TAB" - for forward, "SHIFT + TAB" - for backward propagation. 

~> To Rename/Delete it:
    Copy it's path from vs code.
    Paste it in address bar at top of file explorer removing the name of file from end.
    Press enter to move to the folder where these snippets are stored.
    Delete of Rename them normally as per choice from there.
    Path is like: "C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\cpp.code-snippets"
                  Remove"cpp.code-snippets" in address bar of file explorer.
