~> Snippets are predefined code templates that expand into full code when you type a prefix + Tab / Enter.
~> Can be committed to GitHub under .vscode folder in root folder

~> File Extensions:
    *.code-snippets are global or workspace reusable snippet files, while *.json snippet files are language-specific and apply only to the defined programming language.
        - *.code-snippets files are global user snippets
        - *.json files are local user snippets

~> Usage:
    They are used to:
        (i) Reduce repetitive typing
        (ii) Avoid syntax errors
        (iii) Speed up development
        (iv) Maintain consistent code style

~> Types/ Levels:
    VS Code supports three levels of snippets:
        (i) Global User Snippets (*.code-snippets files):
            - Works on all languages & projects
            - Used in all projects
            - Used in all languages (unless restricted)
            - Example: (Works in JS, React, Node, anywhere)
                {
                    "Print to console": {
                        "prefix": "cl",
                        "body": "console.log($1);",
                        "description": "Log output to console"
                    }
                }
        (ii) Workspace Snippets (.vscode/*.code-snippets files): One project only
            - Restrict global snippet to a language
            - Example:
                {
                    "React useState": {
                        "scope": "javascriptreact",
                        "prefix": "us",
                        "body": [
                            "const [$1, set$2] = useState($3);"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            (iii) Language-specific Snippets	(<language>.json files): One language only
                - Snippets that work only for one language
                - File name format: <language>.json
                - Example:
                    {
                        "Arrow Function": {
                            "prefix": "af",
                            "body": [
                                "const $1 = ($2) => {",
                                    "  $0",
                                "};"
                            ],
                            "description": "Create arrow function"
                        }
                    }

~> Storage Paths:
    They are stored in:
        - Windows:
            C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\
        - Linux:
            ~/.config/Code/User/snippets/
        - macOS:
            ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets/

~> Placeholders
    (i) Cursor positions:           $1, $2	
    (ii) Final cursor position:     $0
    (iii) Default value:            ${1:name}
    (iv) one,two:                   ${1,2}

~> Snippets vs Extensions
    (Snippets)	            (Extensions)
    Simple templates	    Full features
    Lightweight	            Heavier
    Custom	                Pre-built
    Fast	                Powerful

~> Order of preference:
    Local overrides global.
    Workspace snippets > Language snippets > Global snippets

~> Real-world Example (React Dev)
    Global snippet → rfc
    Project snippet → apiCall
    Language snippet → useEffect

~> Working:
    How VS Code Knows When to Trigger a Snippet
    A snippet appears when:
        1. File language matches scope
        2. Typed text matches prefix
        3. Tab or Enter is pressed
        4. Settings involved:
            "editor.tabCompletion": "on"

~> To backup vscode snippets:
    Step 1>
        Create a folder named "vscode\snippets" if not exsists already
    Step 2>
        To copy all .json snipppets of vscode
        run this command:

            copy "$env:APPDATA\Code\User\snippets\*" vscode\snippets\
